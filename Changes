Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-Adapter

{{$NEXT}}

  [ADDED]

  - Added 'scope' option to control lifecycle of created objects

  [CHANGED]

  - Default scope is now 'request' instead of (effectively) 'singleton' in
    the previous implementation.  This makes the default behavior safer to
    ensure data is not leaked between requests.
